Pizza Instructions

- Get up from your desk
- Avoiding any obstacles (like desks), walk towards the table at the front of the room
- Stand in front of the table facing the pizza boxes
- If any is open, look to see what the flavor is (vegetable or pepperoni)
- If it is the flavor you want, grab a plate from the table, hold it upright, take a slice of that pizza, and place it on the plate
- If it is not the flavor you want, open boxes and repeat
